# 🖥️ Virtual PC Controller

This project allows you to **control your PC virtually using hand gestures** via a webcam.
It combines **computer vision** 🧠 and **gesture recognition** ✋ to create two main features:

1. ⌨ **Virtual Keyboard** – Type by hovering your finger over keys on a virtual keyboard displayed on the screen.
2. 🖱 **Virtual Mouse** – Move and click your mouse cursor using hand gestures.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🖱 Virtual Mouse

* 🎯 Move the cursor by moving your index finger within a defined region.
* 👆 Click by pinching your index and middle fingers together.
* 🔄 Smoothened cursor movement for better control.
* 🖥 Works on **any screen resolution**.

### ⌨ Virtual Keyboard

* 🖥 On-screen keyboard with QWERTY layout.
* ⏳ Hover over a key for **2 seconds** to type it.
* ✅ Visual feedback for pressed keys.
* ⚡ Real-time hand tracking with key detection.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* 🐍 **Python**
* 🎥 **OpenCV** – Real-time image processing.
* 🔢 **NumPy** – Coordinate mapping & calculations.
* 🎯 **cvzone** – Easy OpenCV utilities (corner rectangles, etc.).
* ⌨ **pynput** – Simulates keyboard presses.
* 🖱 **pyautogui** – Controls mouse movements and clicks.
* ✋ **Custom Hand Tracking Module** – Built using **MediaPipe** for detecting hand landmarks.

## ⚙ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Hand Tracking

* ✋ The `HandTrackingModule` detects hand landmarks using **MediaPipe**.
* 📍 Coordinates of fingertips (index & middle fingers) are used for control.

### 2️⃣ Virtual Mouse

* 🖱 Index finger → Cursor movement.
* 👆 Index + Middle fingers together → Click action.

### 3️⃣ Virtual Keyboard

* ⏳ Finger hovering over a key for a set duration → Key press.
* 💡 Visual indication when a key is pressed.
